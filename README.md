## Quick Start

Under root directory run `python -m referee <white package> <black package>`

where python is the name of a Python 3.6 interpreter and \<white package> \<black package> are the names of packages containing the class Player to be used for White and Black, respectively.

In particular, to play(test) against yourself, run `python -m referee NeCho NeCho`
